# Credit Risk Classification Instructions

Use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. 
Use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Steps
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to build and evaluate a machine learning model using a logistic regression classification algorithm to predict credit risk. Speficially, the analysis aimed to classify loands as either "healthy" (low risk) or "high risk" based on historical lending activity. Logistic regression was the primary algorightm used in this analysis. It is suitable for binary classification tasks and provides probabilities for class membership.

### Data Attributes (77,536 entries)
* `loan size`
* `interest_rate`
* `borrower_income`
* `debt_to_income`
* `num_of_accounts`
* `derogatory_marks`
* `total_debt`

### ML Process
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data split into  training and testing sets
3. Train the model
4. Fit the model
5. Test the model
6. Evaluate the accurace of the model

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
